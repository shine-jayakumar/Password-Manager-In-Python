### Why a password Manager?
A couple of months ago I stumbled upon a YouTube video that talked about how much of your information is floating around on the internet and a simple search can reveal so much about you. One compromised website can reveal your password putting all other accounts at risk

A website like [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/ "have i been pwned?") can show you if one of the services you signed up for was ever compromised. 

In a [survey conducted by Google](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/google-survey-finds-two-users/ "survey conducted by Google") with a pool of 3000 people, 51% admitted that they use the same favourite password for different websites.
I admit I am guilty too of this bad habit. Most of the times, itâ€™s not the lack of knowledge that lands us into trouble but negligence.
I took my first step - I decided to write a simple password manager. Now, you can write your own or, just run this one.
